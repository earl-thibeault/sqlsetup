This small program is ment to work whith fastapi sqlite sqlalchemy and pandenic in the future
right now it is very limited but its a starting point it takes the output from .schema as a txt file
parses that and makes a rudementry models.py. This is just a first step but when your working with a large 
number of tables or columns or both it is very helpfull. TODO file is included and the only current
 dependency is actully re and i geuss sqlite3 nothing else is really required for this to work the rest of your api won't but this will.
